### About:

Projeto de conclusão do Módulo de Front End do curso da Trybe.

This project consists of creating a mobile application that can help a user when searching and preparing drinks and meals.

Since the beginning of the project, we have always maintained a lot of respect and collaboration between all the people who are part of the team. It was also a huge organizational and communication challenge to keep all people aligned with the progress of the project, because after all, there were 87 requirements to be completed.

So we use some agile methodologies such as Kanban and Scrum to keep the project progress more efficient and transparent. The experience was excellent and we learned a lot from it.

In the application, we use ReactJS, ContextAPI for managing global states, TailwindCSS for styling paying attention to accessibility in WCAG 2.1 standards and React Testing Library for application testing. We also had to deal with information from 2 different API's (TheCocktailDB and TheMealDB) to supply the application with the recipe information.
